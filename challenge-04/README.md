## Whiteboard Challenge 04

*Write a function that will intersect two arrays*

```
// Given the following two arrays
["mike", "sue", "tom", "kathy", "henry"]
["howey", "jim", "sue", "jennifer", "kathy", "hank", "alex"]

// Return
["sue", "kathy"]
```
The goal of this challenge is to write a function that takes in two arrays as an argument and returns a new array with the matching elements of the original arguments.

The tests:
* Check for two arguments passed into the function
* Check that the arguments passed are arrays
* Test that the function works as expected (returns separate array)
