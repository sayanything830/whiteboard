## Whiteboard Challenge 02

*Write a function that takes in a numeric array and returns an object literal with two properties: - The highest and second highest value in the array*

*Write at least four tests for this function - Your tests should cover basic functionality - Consider any edge cases for your function, e.g. will your function still operate on an array of floating point integers?*

The tests involve:
* Checking for an array being passed in as an argument, not any other data type
* Checking for the length of the array and if there is only one element, returning and object with the highest value and null as second highest.
* Checking to make sure the array is not empty
* Check if the two highest value elements are equal, they will both be considered the highest and second highest.

**Note:** These tests allow for duplicate high scores and if the array contains all elements of the same value.
